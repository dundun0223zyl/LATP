This means we are: looking at what you can do rather than what you cannot do having conversations rather than focusing on prescribed assessment questions understanding what is most important to you, your concerns, what you have already tried and what might be the best next steps working with you as an expert in your own life, listening carefully to 'what matters' to you rather than 'what is the matter' with you looking at what family, friends and the communities do to support you",
