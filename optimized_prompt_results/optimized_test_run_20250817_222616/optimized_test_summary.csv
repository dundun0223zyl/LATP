Croydon,scn_24,assessment_scenarios,I'm moving from Croydon to Southampton. Will I need a new care needs assessment or can my current care package transfer?,optimized,optimized_prompt_results/optimized_test_run_20250817_222616/Croydon/scn_24/optimized.json,8.7654390335083,,https://eu.smith.langchain.com/o/me/runs/8dc47d3e-5589-46d3-a9c5-115d707ff5ce,8dc47d3e-5589-46d3-a9c5-115d707ff5ce,10,1683,"**Summary:** When moving from Croydon to Southampton, you will likely need a new care needs assessment as care packages are typically managed by the local authority where you reside.

**Details:**

- **Care Needs Assessment:** Local authorities are responsible for assessing and providing care to residents within their area. When you move to a new area, such as from Croydon to Southampton, the local authority in Southampton will need to conduct their own assessment to determine your care needs and how they can meet them.

- **Transfer of Care Packages:** Care packages are not automatically transferred between local authorities. Each authority has its own procedures and resources, so a new assessment ensures that your needs are met according to the local services available.

**Practical Next Steps:**

- **Contact Southampton Adult Social Care:** As soon as you know your moving date, contact the adult social care team in Southampton to arrange for a new assessment. This will help ensure there is no gap in your care provision.

- **Prepare Documentation:** Have any relevant documentation from Croydon’s adult social care services ready to share with Southampton’s team. This includes previous assessments, care plans, and any correspondence that outlines your care needs.

- **Further Information:** For more specific guidance, you can visit the Southampton City Council's website or contact their adult social care department directly.

The available documents don’t provide specific contact details for Southampton’s adult social care services, so visiting their official website or calling their main council line would be advisable for the most accurate information.",enhanced
