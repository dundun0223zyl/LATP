Between 2010-11 and 2020-21, central government funding for local authorities fell in real terms by over 50%, while resources available to deliver services dropped by 26% (House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts, 2022). \nIn Cambridgeshire, the impact of these pressures is stark.

Between 2010-11 and 2020-21, central government funding for local authorities fell in real terms by over 50%, while resources available to deliver services dropped by 26% (House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts, 2022). \nIn Cambridgeshire, the impact of these pressures is stark. In 2022, approximately \n16,700 families in Cambridgeshire lived below the poverty line,\n including 13,500\n\n[Document 6] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/council/communities/poverty-strategy-commission - 98 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n(Money Advice Trust, 2024).  \nIn Cambridgeshire, these pressures are acutely felt. Over 37,000 residents are  \nestimated to be living in negative budgets, with the highest rates found in  \nCambridge and Fenland \u2013 areas affected respectively by high housing costs and  \npersistent rural deprivation (Citizens Advice, 2024). The number of people  \nreceiving Universal Credit in the county has risen by 30% over the last four years  \n(Local Government Organisation, 2025). Across the region, people are skipping  \nmeals, using food banks, falling into debt, and struggling to afford essentials such  \nas heating, rent, and childcare. Despite ongoing efforts to tackle poverty, the cost-\nof-living crisis has pushed many households further into financial insecurity.  \nCambridgeshire Poverty Strategy Commission \u2013 final report 29Income maximisation is a vital strategy for reducing poverty and building resilience.  \nIt is billed as a tool not only to support people out of poverty, but also as an\n\n[Document 7] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/council/communities/poverty-strategy-commission - 98 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 9 - FINANCIAL/BUDGET INFORMATION]\nCambridgeshire Poverty Strategy Commission \u2013 final report 17 Cambridgeshire Poverty Strategy Commission \u2013 final report 167%5%\n33%54%\n59%\nof those concerned about\nthe cost of living have\nchanged their behaviour37%\nfeel that their\nmental health\nhas been a\ufb00ected\n44%\nhave cut back on\nheating6%\nhave stopped accessing\nprescription\nmedication6%\nhave had to use a\nfood bank\n25%\nhave cut back on\nnutritious foodFigure 5: \ufeffOf those concerned about the cost of living\u2026\nSource: \ufeffCambridgeshire County Council \u2013 2024\ufeffThis year, those concerned are signi\ufb01cantly more likely to say \u2018none of these apply to me\u2019 \n(39% compared to 32% in 2023).
