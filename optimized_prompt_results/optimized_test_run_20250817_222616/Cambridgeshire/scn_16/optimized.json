  "answer": "If you're concerned about the costs of your home care in Cambridgeshire, you may be eligible for financial assistance through a financial assessment conducted by the council. This assessment will determine if the council can contribute to your care costs based on your financial circumstances.\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: The council will evaluate your income, savings, capital, and any benefits you receive to determine your contribution towards care costs. If your capital or savings exceed \u00a323,250, you will likely need to pay the full cost of your care.\n\n- **Savings Threshold**: If your savings are below \u00a323,250, you may qualify for financial assistance from the council. It's important to note that the value of your home is considered unless it is occupied by a partner, children under 18, or a disabled relative.\n\n- **Self-Funding**: If you are a self-funder, you will be responsible for paying for your own care, but the council can assist you in finding a care provider and managing the contract for a fee.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Contact Cambridgeshire County Council to request a financial assessment. You can find more information and contact details on their website at [www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk).\n- Consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor or a social worker who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the Cambridgeshire County Council's care and support information sheets at [this URL](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets).",
