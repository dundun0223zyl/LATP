  "answer": "Residents in Cambridgeshire pay for social care services based on their income and savings, with specific thresholds determining whether they self-fund or receive council contributions. The costs of care services are influenced by individual financial assessments, which consider income, savings, and property value.\n\n- **Self-Funding Thresholds**: If you have savings and investments over **\u00a323,250**, you are expected to pay for your own care. This is known as self-funding. If your savings are between **\u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250**, you may need to contribute to your care costs, with the council potentially covering part of the expenses based on a means-tested financial assessment. Savings below **\u00a314,250** are not counted in the assessment.\n\n- **Personal Budgets**: For those eligible for council-funded care, a personal budget is allocated based on a care and support assessment. This budget is used to meet the cost of care needs, calculated on a weekly basis.\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: The council conducts a financial assessment to determine how much you will pay. This assessment includes your income, savings, and property value, particularly if you enter a care home.\n\n- **Changes in Financial Situation**: Residents must inform the council if their financial situation changes significantly, especially if their capital approaches the **\u00a323,250** threshold.\n\nFor more detailed information or to apply for a financial assessment, residents can visit the Cambridgeshire County Council's website at [https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets).",
