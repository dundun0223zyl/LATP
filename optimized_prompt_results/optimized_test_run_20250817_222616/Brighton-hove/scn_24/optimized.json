This includes when the Council is responsible for funding care and accommodation in residential or nursing home care and complies with the Care Act 2014. Also included within scope of this policy are people living in their own homes and people who were previously self-funding their own care arrangements. 1.2 In summary, an assessment under the auspices of the Care Act 2014 will determine whether a person has eligible care and support needs. The assessment will include whether a person is eligible for care and support needs to be funded by the Council. The Council will listen and take account of the service user's preferences as to how those needs are met",

Also included within scope of this policy are people living in their own homes and people who were previously self-funding their own care arrangements. 1.2 In summary, an assessment under the auspices of the Care Act 2014 will determine whether a person has eligible care and support needs. The assessment will include whether a person is eligible for care and support needs to be funded by the Council. The Council will listen and take account of the service user's preferences as to how those needs are met",

  "answer": "**Summary:** When moving from Brighton & Hove to Southampton, you will likely need a new care needs assessment for your care package, as care arrangements typically do not transfer between local authorities.\n\n**Details:**\n\n- **Care Needs Assessment:** According to the Care Act 2014, each local authority is responsible for assessing and meeting the care needs of its residents. This means that when you move to a new area, such as from Brighton & Hove to Southampton, the new local authority (Southampton City Council) will need to conduct its own assessment to determine your eligibility and the specifics of your care package.\n\n- **Local Authority Responsibility:** The documents indicate that Brighton & Hove City Council follows the Care Act 2014 to assess and fund care needs. This process is specific to each local authority, so a new assessment is necessary when you relocate to ensure your needs are met according to the policies and resources of the new area.\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n\n- **Contact Southampton City Council:** Reach out to Southampton City Council's Adult Social Care team to initiate a new care needs assessment. You can find contact information on their official website.\n\n- **Prepare Documentation:** Gather any relevant documentation from your current care package and assessment in Brighton & Hove to provide to Southampton City Council, which may help streamline the assessment process.\n\n- **Further Information:** For more details on the assessment process in Southampton, visit their official website or contact their Adult Social Care services directly.",
