  "answer": "If your care needs have increased in Brighton & Hove, you may be eligible for additional financial support from the council, but it will depend on an assessment of your needs and financial situation.\n\n- **Assessment for Eligibility**: Brighton & Hove City Council will conduct an assessment under the Care Act 2014 to determine if you have eligible care and support needs that the council can fund. This assessment will consider your current situation and preferences for how your needs should be met (Documents 1 and 2).\n\n- **Financial Support Conditions**: While you are receiving Attendance Allowance, the council can provide additional financial support if you meet certain conditions. Specifically, if you have less than \u00a33,000 in savings, you might qualify for a \"hardship assessment,\" which could result in the council funding your care in full (Document 3).\n\n- **Next Steps**: To explore additional support, you should contact Brighton & Hove City Council's adult social care services. You can reach them via email at accesspoint@brighton-hove.gov.uk or by phone at 01273 29 55 55 for assistance with the assessment process and to discuss your increased care needs.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the council's website on adult social care policies: [Brighton & Hove Adult Social Care](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/adult-social-care-hub/documents-adult-social-care/choice-policy-adult-social-care).",
