  "answer": "You will likely need a new care needs assessment when moving from Barnet to Southampton. Care packages are typically specific to the local authority that assessed and provided them, and each local authority is responsible for assessing the needs of its residents.\n\n- **New Assessment Requirement**: When you move to a new local authority, such as Southampton, they will need to conduct their own assessment to determine your care needs and eligibility for services. This is in accordance with the Care Act 2014, which mandates that local authorities assess anyone who appears to require care and support.\n\n- **Care Act 2014**: This act requires local authorities to carry out assessments for individuals who may need care and support, regardless of their eligibility for state-funded care. This means that Southampton will need to assess your situation independently of Barnet's previous assessment.\n\n- **Practical Steps**: Contact Southampton's adult social care services as soon as possible to arrange for a new assessment. You can find contact information and more details on their website or by reaching out to their adult social care department directly.\n\nThe available documents don't provide specific information about transferring care packages between local authorities, but the general practice is to undergo a new assessment in the new location.",
