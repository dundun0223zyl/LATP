I cared for my wonderful mum for years through dementia, strokes and macular degeneration and then had to take the painful decision of moving her to a care home when it was no longer the right thing to keep her at home, for her or me. I then wanted to find a way to be there for people in the same situation, to support them and give them ways to help manage their feelings and energies, so I trained as an NLP Practitioner. I would like to offer one or two sessions at the Dementia Hub Coventry to give you an opportunity to talk, be listened to without judgement and give you a couple of coping strategies. The charge for room hire for 1 hour is \u00a35.30 which would be payable by you, and is of course supporting the Dementia Hub at the same time. If you are interested, please call me on 07752 437649 and we can arrange a mutually convenient time and I will arrange room availability",

My name is Angela, I am a qualified NLP Practitioner and have a Diploma in Counselling. I cared for my wonderful mum for years through dementia, strokes and macular degeneration and then had to take the painful decision of moving her to a care home when it was no longer the right thing to keep her at home, for her or me. I then wanted to find a way to be there for people in the same situation, to support them and give them ways to help manage their feelings and energies, so I trained as an NLP Practitioner. I would like to offer one or two sessions at the Dementia Hub Coventry to give you an opportunity to talk, be listened to without judgement and give you a couple of coping strategies. The charge for room hire for 1 hour is \u00a35.30 which would be payable by you, and is of course supporting the Dementia Hub at the same time. If you are interested, please call me on 07752 437649 and we can arrange a mutually convenient time and I will arrange room availability\n\n[Document 3] From coventry city council market position statement 2024 2029 (pdf) - 23 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\nby the third sector under the Preventative Support \nGrant.\nDay opportunities: In 2023 our innovative Coventry \nDementia Partnership Hub opened to the public, \nproviding a one stop shop for dementia services \nincluding day services, outreach, information and \nadvice sessions, a Dementia Friendly Caf\u00e9 and \nsocial space.
