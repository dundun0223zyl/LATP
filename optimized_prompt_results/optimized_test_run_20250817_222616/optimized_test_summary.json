This means that Southampton will need to assess your situation independently of Barnet's previous assessment.\n\n- **Practical Steps**: Contact Southampton's adult social care services as soon as possible to arrange for a new assessment. You can find contact information and more details on their website or by reaching out to their adult social care department directly.\n\nThe available documents don't provide specific information about transferring care packages between local authorities, but the general practice is to undergo a new assessment in the new location.",

    "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 in Brighton & Hove, his financial support will transition from children's to adult services. This change involves a different assessment process and potentially different funding mechanisms.\n\n**Key Changes and Considerations:**\n\n- **Transition to Adult Services:** As he turns 18, your son will move from children's services to adult social care services. This transition may involve a reassessment of his needs to determine the appropriate level of support and funding.\n\n- **Adult Social Care Charging Reform:** Although reforms are planned for October 2025, which include a more generous means-test and a cap on care costs, these changes are not yet in effect. Therefore, the current system will apply until then.\n\n- **Budget and Funding:** The adult social care budget is influenced by inflationary pressures and cost constraints. The council sets annual fees for services, which include residential and home care, and these are reviewed annually (Document 1, Document 5).\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Contact Adult Social Care Services:** Reach out to Brighton & Hove's Adult Social Care Hub for guidance on the transition process and to initiate any necessary assessments. They can provide detailed information on available services and funding options.\n\n2. **Explore Online Resources:** Utilize the council's online 'Self-Service' Adult Social Care Hub to find information and advice about support options. This includes an Easy Read Hub for those with learning difficulties (Document 4).\n\n3. **Stay Informed About Reforms:** Keep an eye on upcoming changes to the Adult Social Care Charging Reform, which may affect future financial support and care arrangements.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the Brighton & Hove Adult Social Care website: [Brighton & Hove Adult Social Care](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/adult-social-care/about-adult-social-care).",

These services include personal budgets, direct payments, and various forms of care such as in-home care, residential care, and support for personal care or mental health needs.\n\n**Eligibility Criteria:**\n- **Social Care Assessment:** This assessment evaluates your strengths and needs to determine the support required.

If your savings are below \u00a323,250, you may be eligible for council support, with contributions varying based on your financial situation.\n\n**Key Financial Information:**\n- If your capital is above \u00a323,250, you are considered a 'self-funder' and will pay for your own care.\n- If your capital is between \u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250, you may receive partial council support, subject to a means-tested assessment.\n- Savings below \u00a314,250 are not counted in the financial assessment.\n\n**Practical Steps:**\n- **Contact the Council:** If you believe you need support, contact Cambridgeshire County Council to discuss your situation. They may suggest a social care assessment.\n- **Explore Options:** Before seeking council support, consider equipment, technology, and community help to maintain independence.\n- **Further Information:** Visit [Cambridgeshire County Council's website](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support) for more details on organizing care and support.\n\nAccording to the documents, these steps and criteria are designed to ensure that those in need receive appropriate and timely support while considering their financial circumstances.",

    "answer": "Residents in Cambridgeshire pay for social care services based on their income and savings, with specific thresholds determining whether they self-fund or receive council contributions. The costs of care services are influenced by individual financial assessments, which consider income, savings, and property value.\n\n- **Self-Funding Thresholds**: If you have savings and investments over **\u00a323,250**, you are expected to pay for your own care. This is known as self-funding. If your savings are between **\u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250**, you may need to contribute to your care costs, with the council potentially covering part of the expenses based on a means-tested financial assessment. Savings below **\u00a314,250** are not counted in the assessment.\n\n- **Personal Budgets**: For those eligible for council-funded care, a personal budget is allocated based on a care and support assessment. This budget is used to meet the cost of care needs, calculated on a weekly basis.\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: The council conducts a financial assessment to determine how much you will pay. This assessment includes your income, savings, and property value, particularly if you enter a care home.\n\n- **Changes in Financial Situation**: Residents must inform the council if their financial situation changes significantly, especially if their capital approaches the **\u00a323,250** threshold.\n\nFor more detailed information or to apply for a financial assessment, residents can visit the Cambridgeshire County Council's website at [https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets).",

It's important to note that the value of your home is considered unless it is occupied by a partner, children under 18, or a disabled relative.\n\n- **Self-Funding**: If you are a self-funder, you will be responsible for paying for your own care, but the council can assist you in finding a care provider and managing the contract for a fee.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Contact Cambridgeshire County Council to request a financial assessment. You can find more information and contact details on their website at [www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk).\n- Consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor or a social worker who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the Cambridgeshire County Council's care and support information sheets at [this URL](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets).",

    "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 in Cambridgeshire, his financial support will transition from children's to adult services, which involves a new assessment process to determine eligibility for council-funded care and support.\n\n**Key Information:**\n- **Financial Assessment:** Upon transitioning to adult services, your son will need a financial assessment to determine how much he will contribute towards his care. This is based on his income and savings.\n- **Savings Thresholds:** If he has savings over **\u00a323,250**, he will be considered a self-funder and will pay for his own care. If his savings are between **\u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250**, he may need to contribute to his care costs, with the council potentially covering some expenses. Savings below **\u00a314,250** will not be counted in the assessment.\n- **Personal Budget:** If eligible, your son will receive a personal budget, which is an amount of council funding allocated to meet his social care needs. This budget is calculated based on a care and support assessment.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- **Contact Cambridgeshire County Council:** To initiate the transition process, contact the council to arrange a care and support assessment. You can find more information and contact details on their website: [Cambridgeshire County Council Adult Services](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets).\n- **Prepare for Assessment:** Gather information about your son's current care needs, income, and savings to facilitate the assessment process.\n\nThe available documents don't provide specific information about any changes in the types of services or support your son might receive upon transitioning to adult services.

For 20 hours weekly, this would total approximately **\u00a3370.20 per week**.\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: You should contact the financial assessment team to determine your eligibility for financial support. They can be reached at **020 8726 6000 ext 44145** or via the Charging Helpline at **020 8760 5676**.\n\n- **Deferred Payments Scheme**: If you are assessed to pay the full cost, you might consider the deferred payments scheme, which allows you to defer care payments until a later date. For more details, contact the financial assessment officer or email **deferredpayments@croydon.gov.uk**.\n\n- **Additional Support**: If you pay for private care in addition to council care, inform your financial assessment officer so this can be considered in your financial assessment.\n\nFor further information and to apply for financial assistance, visit the Croydon Council's adult social care page at [Croydon Adult Social Care](https://www.croydon.gov.uk/adult-health-and-social-care/paying-adult-social-care/adult-social-care).",
