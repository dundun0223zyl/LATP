  "answer": "The available documents don't provide specific information about whether your current care package from Birmingham can be transferred directly to Southampton or if you will need a new care needs assessment. \n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Transition Arrangements:** The documents mention transition arrangements for care packages within Birmingham, but do not specify procedures for transferring care packages between different local authorities, such as from Birmingham to Southampton.\n- **New Assessments:** Typically, when moving to a new local authority, a new care needs assessment is required to ensure the care package meets local criteria and resources.\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n- **Contact Local Authorities:** Reach out to both Birmingham City Council and Southampton City Council for guidance on transferring your care package.\n- **CareMatch Portal:** Use the CareMatch Portal for more information on care services in Birmingham, which might provide additional contacts or resources ([CareMatch Portal](https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/50173/providers_of_care_services)).\n\nFor further assistance, you may also want to contact the adult social care departments of both councils directly.",
