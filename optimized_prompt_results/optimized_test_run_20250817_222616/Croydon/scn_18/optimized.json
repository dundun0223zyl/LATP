Visit their website at [Croydon Adult Social Care](https://www.croydon.gov.uk/adult-health-and-social-care) for contact details and further assistance.\n- **Consult the Croydon Council Website**: As the website is being updated for better accessibility, check for any new information regarding adult social care services and financial support options.\n- **Speak with a Social Worker**: Engaging with a social worker who specializes in transitions from children's to adult services can provide personalized guidance and support.\n\nFor more detailed and specific advice, reaching out to these resources will be beneficial.",
