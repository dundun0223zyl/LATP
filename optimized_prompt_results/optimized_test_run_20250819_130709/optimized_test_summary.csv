- If a resident's capital exceeds £23,250, they are typically required to self-fund their care. Once their capital falls below this threshold, they can seek council assistance (Document 6).

- Residents pay based on their assessed contribution, which is calculated by the council's Charging Team after evaluating their financial circumstances (Document 4).

- **Asset Consideration**: Assets such as property, land, savings, and shares will be considered in the financial assessment, as per the Care Act 2014.

When moving between local authorities in the UK, your current care package does not automatically transfer. Each local authority is responsible for conducting its own assessment of your care needs to determine eligibility and the appropriate support services.

**Relevant Details:**

- **Care Needs Assessment:** According to the Care Act 2014, local authorities must assess individuals to determine their eligibility for care services. This means that when you move to a new area, such as Southampton, the local council there will need to conduct a new assessment to establish your needs and the support they can provide.
  
- **Contact Information:** To initiate this process, you should contact the adult social care team in Southampton. They will guide you on how to proceed with your assessment and what documentation you might need to provide.

**Practical Next Steps:**

1. **Contact Southampton's Adult Social Care Team:** Reach out to them as soon as possible to discuss your move and start the process of arranging a new assessment.
   
2. **Prepare Documentation:** Gather any relevant documents from York regarding your current care package and assessments, as these may be helpful in the new assessment process.

3. **Further Information:** For more detailed guidance, you can visit the Southampton City Council's website or contact their social care services directly.

The available documents don't provide specific contact information for Southampton's social care services, but you can typically find this on the local council's official website.",enhanced
