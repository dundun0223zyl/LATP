Respite care can take many forms from a volunteer sitting with the person they care for while they attend an appointment through to planned or emergency overnight short-term residential respite to cover for example holidays. Respite care and short breaks can be arranged by the local authority or paid for using a direct payment.

We work in partnership with the Carers Trust Heart of England to deliver a one-stop shop for people with caring responsibilities.
