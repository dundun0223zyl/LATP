This means significant savings need to be made to help the Council balance its budget. Adult Social Care will be required to make savings too. We must use these diminishing resources in the best way we can to support Coventry citizens and deliver the objectives set out in the City Council 10-year plan. This is at a time when we know there will be more older people, more people living with long-term health conditions and more people needing support from family and friends. \nTo support the delivery of change, an Adult Social Care Commissioning and Personalisation Plan \nhas been developed which includes an action plan on what changes we propose to make, how these changes will be delivered, and most importantly what improvement we will expect to see as a result over the next two years. The plan is available at\nwww.coventry.gov.uk/adultsocialcarecpp2014",

This means significant savings need to be made to help the Council balance its budget. Adult Social Care will be required to make savings too. We must use these diminishing resources in the best way we can to support Coventry citizens and deliver the objectives set out in the City Council 10-year plan. This is at a time when we know there will be more older people, more people living with long-term health conditions and more people needing support from family and friends. \nTo support the delivery of change, an Adult Social Care Commissioning and Personalisation Plan \nhas been developed which includes an action plan on what changes we propose to make, how these changes will be delivered, and most importantly what improvement we will expect to see as a result over the next two years. The plan is available at\nwww.coventry.gov.uk/adultsocialcarecpp2014\n\n[Document 2] From coventry local account for adult social care 2012 13 (pdf) - 39 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 39]\nAdult Social Care Annual Report 2012/13    39     Contact Us\nYou can contact us about this report at: \ncomcare.consult@coventry.gov.uk\n \nYou can contact Adults Social Care at:  \ne-mail: coventrydirect@coventry.gov.uk \nor Tel: 0500 834 333 \nAny comments, compliments or complaints can be made by contacting Coventry Direct on 0500 834 333, in person at any of the Council\u2019s reception or enquiry areas, or by filling in an online form here.\nhttp://www.coventry.gov.uk/speakup \nYou can visit the Opal Assessment and Demonstration Centre:\nMonday-Thursday: 9:30am \u2013 4:30 pm, Friday 9:30am \u2013 4:00pmUnit 17-18, Bishopsgate Business Park, Widdrington Road, Coventry , CV1 4NA\nTel: 024 7678 5252\nMore information about Adult Social Care can be found here.\nIf you need this information in another format or langauge please contact:\nTel: 0500 834 333\n\n[Document 3] From adult social care annual report 2018 19 (pdf) - 38 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\nbut we continue to face financial pressures and have \nseen an increasing complexity in people\u2019s needs.
