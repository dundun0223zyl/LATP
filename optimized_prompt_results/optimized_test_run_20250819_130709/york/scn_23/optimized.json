Cost of reablement services While your social care needs are assessed , you will not be charged for your reablement support; this can be from a few days or up to a maximum of six weeks. We'll review your progress at three weeks and if you require ongoing support, you may need to contribute to the cost of your care, depending on your financial assessment.
