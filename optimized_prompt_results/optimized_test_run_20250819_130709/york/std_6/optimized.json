Covid-19 restrictions were particularly acute in York where a significant proportion of businesses and workers operated the sectors hit hardest such as retail, health and social care and hospitality. \nRe-opening York after the first lockdown \nwe implemented a One Year Transport and Place Strategy, expanding pedestrianised areas to create space for social distancing, and managed seating and outdoor space for hospitality. Throughout different lockdowns and tier systems we were able to support our economy by being flexible, creative, whilst ensuring public health always remained the priority. We have provided over 25,000 Government grants to York businesses worth over \u00a3114 million and invested \u00a31 million in additional local support. We also established a Business Growth Voucher Scheme providing vouchers to around 550 local businesses.",
