However, it has been noted that there are concerns about the quality and size of the sample, and particularly regarding the business costs reflected in the medians. Therefore, consideration should be given to concerns that the medians derived may not be reasonable and reflective of the whole market. The current actual fee rate paid by Oxfordshire County Council stands at \u00a325.20, which is outside the boundaries of a 95% confidence interval based on these medians. For comparison, the median cost per hour identified through CoC is \u00a330.12, which falls within the range of the 95% confidence interval.\n\n[Document 7] From https://www (docx) - URL: https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/business/information-providers/adult-social-care-providers/cost-care-report [Retrieved via: semantic_expanded_2]:\nBased on the information presented in this report, the current fee rates paid by Oxfordshire County Council are below the  cost of care, as calculated based on the median rate of return.

This latter figure is supported by Oxfordshire\u2019s previous Cost of Care exercise commissioned in 2020 which returned business costs at \u00a35.94 per hour, which would rise to \u00a36.20 when inflated for 2022/23 prices. On this basis the Council has determined it should accept business costs at the higher of these two figures at \u00a36.20 per hour. This sets Oxfordshire County Council\u2019s Cost of Care rate at \u00a326.15.\n\nIn determining an appropriate rate for return on operations, Oxfordshire considered a number of factors:\n\n[Document 9] From https://www (docx) - URL: https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/business/information-providers/adult-social-care-providers/cost-care-report [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\nIn 2023/24 Oxfordshire will be allocated \u00a35.4m of the \u00a3562m. This is an increase of \u00a33.8m from the amount received in 2022/23 and therefore reflects the additional budget available to be allocated. This has enabled us to increase the annual uplift by 1% for providers beyond the amount set aside in the Council's Budget.\n\nAt the Autumn Statement in 2022 it was announced that the grant would increase by a further \u00a3283m to \u00a3683m nationally in 2024/25, assuming the same share of the funding it is assumed that Oxfordshire would receive an additional \u00a31.1m, at this time this funding has not been confirmed or allocated. The median cost of care calculated in the exercise is not currently affordable within the grant awarded to the council, and therefore it is not possible to move to paying this immediately.\n\n[Document 10] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/social-and-health-care/adult-social-care/adult-social-care-policies - 16 pages [Retrieved via: financial_enhanced]:\nan essential part of Oxfordshire County Council\u2019s financial strategy.  \n \n7.
