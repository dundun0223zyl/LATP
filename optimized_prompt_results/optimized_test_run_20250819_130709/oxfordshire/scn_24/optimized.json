  "answer": "When moving from Oxfordshire to Southampton, you will likely need a new care needs assessment from the local authority in Southampton. Care packages are typically managed by the local authority where you are an ordinary resident, as defined by where you pay your council tax. Therefore, your current care package from Oxfordshire will not automatically transfer to Southampton.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **New Assessment Required:** You will need to contact the local authority in Southampton to request a new care needs assessment. This is necessary because care services are provided based on the local authority's jurisdiction where you reside.\n- **Ordinary Residence:** Your eligibility for support is determined by your ordinary residence, which is linked to the local authority to which you pay council tax (Document 2).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- **Contact Southampton's Social Care Services:** Reach out to the Adult Social Care team in Southampton to initiate the process of a new needs assessment.\n- **Prepare for Assessment:** Consider preparing for your assessment by gathering any relevant documents or information about your current care needs and services received in Oxfordshire.\n\nFor more information on how to proceed with a new assessment in Southampton, you may want to visit their local council website or contact their social care services directly.",
