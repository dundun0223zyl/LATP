Our analysis of Market Sustainability and Improvement Fund 2023 to 2024 care provider fees show that Oxfordshire was the 5th highest paying local authority nationally.\n\nAt the end of May 2024, we were purchasing 32,022 hours of home care per week, a 7.7% increase compared to 12 months ago. This home care supported 2,446 people, 75% of this care was delivered to people over the age of 65. It is estimated that the Council purchases around half of the total homecare services provided in Oxfordshire. \n\nWith our new model, we reduced the time to source home care substantially (from 10 working days in May 2021 to 4 working days in May 2024). The number of people waiting for home care has reduced by 51% in the last 12 months. Increasingly we are able to meet assessed needs for home care in a timely manner.",
