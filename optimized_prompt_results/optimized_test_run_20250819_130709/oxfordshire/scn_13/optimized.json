We are developing a range of  \nservices to provide care at home, including Extra Care Housing which aims to provide an  \nalternative to care home accommodation.  \nOur intention is to ensure that care homes are only used for people who can no longer safely  \nremain in their own home, and primarily for those with nursing and/or specialist needs, for  \nexample dementia.  \nFor adults of working age (under 65) with care and support needs we have developed a  \nprogramme of Supported Living services to replace the use of care home placements. The vast  \nmajority of these people are cared for within Oxfordshire, however there are some cases where  \nthey are cared for in neighbouring areas and for people with the most complex needs this could  \nbe further away.",

We are developing a range of  \nservices to provide care at home, including Extra Care Housing which aims to provide an  \nalternative to care home accommodation.  \nOur intention is to ensure that care homes are only used for people who can no longer safely  \nremain in their own home, and primarily for those with nursing and/or specialist needs, for  \nexample dementia.  \nFor adults of working age (under 65) with care and support needs we have developed a  \nprogramme of Supported Living services to replace the use of care home placements. The vast  \nmajority of these people are cared for within Oxfordshire, however there are some cases where  \nthey are cared for in neighbouring areas and for people with the most complex needs this could  \nbe further away.\n\n[Document 2] From https://www (docx) - URL: https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/business/information-providers/adult-social-care-providers/general-information [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\nWe believe that the right reablement and the right homecare at the right time can keep people healthy and independent for longer and which in turn can delay the need for residential care.\n\nWe need trained and competent staff to support people at home, often with more complex needs and will continue to work with providers to deliver our Workforce Strategy.\n\nWe continue to deliver quick turnaround for package sourcing and wider capacity to meet the needs of people wherever they live in the county.\n\nWe need to focus on ensuring people leave hospital at the right time with the appropriate level of support to enable them to live at home.\n\n# Extra Care Housing\n\nExtra Care Housing consists of self\u2013contained housing, primarily for older people, which offers care and support on site. There are a number of private retirement villages in Oxfordshire which offer older people an option to buy a property in an area well connected to local amenities, but these are not included in our de\ufb01nition of Extra Care Housing.\n\n[Document 3] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/social-and-health-care/social-and-health-care-information-professionals/housing-options - 40 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 13]\n\u2022We need experienced staff to support people who are living longer, often with more \ncomplex\u00a0 needs  \n\u2022We want to work with people who receive care, their families/carers, providers and other key  \nstakeholders to co-produce a new model of homecare that meets people\u2019s needs, is  \nsustainable and provides market growth  \nOxfordshire Market Position Statement 2019-22 13\n\u2022We need to work with providers to develop a range of initiatives to support and encourage  \npeople to enter and more importantly stay working in the sector . \n\u2022We need to increase the speed of package sourcing and wider capacity to meet the needs of  \npeople wherever they live in the county .  \n\u2022We need to focus on ensuring people leave hospital at the right time with the appropriate  \nlevel of support to enable them to live at home.\n\n[Document 4] From https://www (web_page) - URL: https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/social-and-health-care/adult-social-care/living-home [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n--\n\nServices to help you stay living at home Helping you or someone you care for to stay in their own home.

  "answer": "If you are caring for your elderly father with Parkinson's in Oxfordshire and need respite care options, there are several services available to support you. **Respite care options include short stay beds, day care, and residential respite care.** These services are designed to provide temporary relief for caregivers.\n\n- **Short Stay Beds:** Oxfordshire Council and the Clinical Commissioning Group offer short stay beds through a block contract. These are used for temporary accommodation and respite care, allowing caregivers to take breaks while ensuring their loved ones are cared for.\n\n- **Day Care and Residential Respite:** There is an emphasis on improving access to residential respite and day care options, which can provide you with the necessary support while you manage your work commitments.\n\n- **Needs Assessment:** You can request a needs assessment to determine the specific care requirements for your father and explore the most suitable respite care options. This can be done through social workers, health professionals, or family members.\n\nFor more information and to explore these options, you can visit the Oxfordshire County Council's website or contact their social care services directly. This will help you access the support you need to balance your caregiving responsibilities with your work.",
