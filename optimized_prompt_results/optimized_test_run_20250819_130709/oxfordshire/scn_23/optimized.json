Meeting urgent needs Where a person has urgent needs for care and support, the council will work with them and anyone else involved to put interim arrangements in place quickly. The same support planning aims and approach will apply. The person\u2019s situation will be kept under review. Once it becomes appropriate to do so, the council will support the person to consider next steps. This will be done on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the person and others involved such as family, friends and other professionals. Continuity of care When a person chooses to move to Oxfordshire or from Oxfordshire to another area, the council will work closely with the other local authority to ensure there is no interruption to the person\u2019s care and support. When a person chooses to move to Oxfordshire, wherever possible the council will carry out a needs assessment and aim to begin the support planning process prior to the day of the move\n\n[Document 4] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/business/information-providers/adult-social-care-providers/fees-and-reviews - 2 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n3.
