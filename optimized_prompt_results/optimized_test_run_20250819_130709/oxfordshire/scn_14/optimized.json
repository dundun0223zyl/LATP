Background  \n \nThe Care Act 2014 gives adult carers the right to receive support from their \nlocal authority if they have eligible needs.  The Local Authority has a duty to \nassess carers when they come to their attention, provide carers with support \nto meet their needs ac cording to national eligibility criteria, and a duty to \nprovide information and advice, to promote wellbeing and to prevent people \nneeding support, where possible.  Young carers are those under 18 years old \nwith caring responsibilities. Their rights to be assessed come mostly from the \nChildren\u2019s Act 1989 and the Children and Families Act 2014, and as part of \nthe whole family approach.
