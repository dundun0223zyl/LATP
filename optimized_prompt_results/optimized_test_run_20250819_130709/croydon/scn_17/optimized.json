  "answer": "If your care needs have increased in Croydon, you may be eligible for additional financial support through a reassessment of your care needs by the council. **Contact Croydon Council to request an adult social care assessment** to determine if your current support plan meets your increased needs.\n\n- **Direct Payments**: If you are eligible for community care services, you might receive direct payments to manage your care needs independently. This can be reassessed to ensure it aligns with your current requirements (Document 1).\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: After your care and support assessment, you will receive a financial assessment form. Completing this form is crucial to determine any additional financial support you might be eligible for (Document 2).\n\n- **Contact Information**: For more details or to initiate a reassessment, you can contact Croydon Council at 020 8726 6000 or visit their website at [Croydon Adult Social Care](https://www.croydon.gov.uk/adult-health-and-social-care/paying-adult-social-care/direct-payments-adults).\n\nIf you need further assistance or have specific questions about your financial assessment, you can speak with a financial assessment officer by calling 0208 760 5676 or emailing deferredpayments@croydon.gov.uk (Document 5).\n\nFor more comprehensive guidance, you can also explore resources on Croydon's website or contact their services directly to ensure your care needs are adequately met.",
