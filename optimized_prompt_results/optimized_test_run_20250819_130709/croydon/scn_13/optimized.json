Having a break from your caring role is important for your wellbeing and quality of life. It can help you recharge your batteries and continue in your caring role for as long as you wish to. If you need a break, you can arrange respite (replacement care for the person you care for) privately, through friends and family or via the council. Eligibility Anyone looking after a friend, family member or neighbour who needs their help due to illness, disability or old age may be eligible for respite.

Some carers reported suffering \nfrom back and shoulder injuries caused by either \nhaving to physically move another person or \nperforming household tasks. \nFor those carers that were working, the balance \nbetween work, caring and looking after themselves \nwas challenging.  Carers\u2019 work had been affected \nby tiredness and stress and they raised that it was \nmore difficult to get support if they were working  \nall day.   \nCarers highlighted being able to take a break, \nrespite, as being particularly important to them.  \nThe ability to have anything from a few hours to a \nproper holiday really helped both their mental and \nphysical wellbeing.Our plan is to:\n\u2022 provide a range of timely funded respite",

Having a break from your caring role is important for your wellbeing and quality of life. It can help you recharge your batteries and continue in your caring role for as long as you wish to. If you need a break, you can arrange respite (replacement care for the person you care for) privately, through friends and family or via the council. Eligibility Anyone looking after a friend, family member or neighbour who needs their help due to illness, disability or old age may be eligible for respite.

A large number of places are occupied by self\u2011funders or out of borough placements. This can result in high demand for a few places for local authority funded eligible older adults who need nursing or residential care.LONG \u2011TERM CONDITIONS\nLong\u2011term conditions are more common in older people and age increases the chances of having more than one condition. In addition, most individual long\u2011term conditions are more common in poorer sections of society, and are more severe in nature even when less common. It is estimated there will be rising demand for prevention and management of multi\u2011morbidity rather than of single disease.\nOLDER CARERS\n",
