  "answer": "**You will likely need a new care needs assessment when moving from Croydon to Southampton.**\n\nWhen you move to a new local authority area, such as from Croydon to Southampton, the new authority will generally require a fresh assessment to ensure that your care needs are accurately identified and met according to their local services and resources. This is because each local authority is responsible for assessing and arranging care for residents within their area.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\n- **Contact Southampton Adult Social Care Services**: Reach out to them as soon as possible to inform them of your move and to initiate the process for a new care needs assessment.\n- **Prepare Documentation**: Gather any existing care plans, assessments, and relevant medical information to provide to Southampton's social care team.\n- **Consult Croydon Adult Social Care**: Before moving, discuss your situation with your current social worker in Croydon to understand any transitional support they might offer.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you may want to visit the Southampton City Council's website or contact their adult social care services directly.",
