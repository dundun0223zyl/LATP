  "answer": "If your care needs have increased in Leeds, you may be eligible for additional support from the council. While Attendance Allowance is a benefit that helps with personal care costs, Leeds City Council can provide additional social care support, which may include financial assistance depending on your circumstances.\n\n- **Social Care Support**: You can receive a paid carer as part of a support plan from the council. This is not free, but you may qualify for help to pay for some or all of it. You should contact Leeds City Council to discuss your needs and arrange an assessment for social care support. More information can be found on their website: [Leeds Adult Social Care](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/adult-social-care/help-at-home/care-in-your-home).\n\n- **Direct Payments**: If you prefer to arrange your own care, you might be eligible for direct payments, which allow you to hire a personal assistant or care agency directly. The Leeds Direct Payment and PA Support Hub can provide assistance with this process. Contact them via email at LeedsDPandPAsupporthub@leeds.gov.uk or by phone at 0113 378 3936.\n\n- **Additional Financial Support**: If your financial situation is affected by your increased care needs, you can explore other benefits or financial support options, such as Carer\u2019s Allowance or Council Tax Support.
