  "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 and transitions to adult services in Leeds, his financial support may change based on his assessed needs and financial situation. **If his savings and investments are less than \u00a323,250, he could qualify for help to pay for his care and support plan.** Some services might be free, while others may require payment or partial payment, depending on the assessment.\n\n- **Transition Assessment**: Between ages 16 and 18, a social care transition assessment should be conducted to determine the support needed as he moves to adult services. This assessment will help plan for future care arrangements, including financial support (Document 4).\n\n- **Council Tax Exemption**: If your son is confirmed as Severely Mentally Impaired (SMI) by a doctor and is entitled to certain benefits, he may qualify for a council tax exemption or discount. If he lives alone or only with others who are SMI, he will be exempt from paying council tax. If he lives with one adult who is eligible to pay council tax, the household will receive a 25% discount (Document 2).\n\nFor more detailed information and to start the transition process, you can visit the Leeds City Council's adult social care page at [leeds.gov.uk/adult-social-care](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/adult-social-care/how-to-get-adult-social-care-and-support/how-much-it-costs) or contact the adult social care team directly.",
