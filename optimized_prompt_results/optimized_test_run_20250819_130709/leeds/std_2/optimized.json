Asking for help If you care for someone and feel like you need support or a rest, you can ask the adult social care team for a carer's assessment. This is a chance for you to have a conversation about how your caring responsibilities affect your wellbeing and quality of life. It is not to judge the care that you provide, but to see how we can help make your life easier. You can ask for an assessment at any time by calling the adult social care team on: 0113 222 4401 (weekdays 9am to 5pm, except Wednesdays from 10am) If you have a social worker, you can ask them to arrange it\u00a0for you.
