  "answer": "Residents in Manchester pay for care services based on a financial assessment of their income and assets, with specific policies for both non-residential and residential care.\n\n**Non-Residential Care Costs:**\n- Residents are assessed to determine how much they can afford to contribute towards their care costs.\n- For example, if a resident's net assessable income is less than the weekly cost of care, they will only pay what they can afford. Mrs. A, with care costs of \u00a3183.71 per week, contributes \u00a3141.30 weekly, as this is her maximum affordable amount (Document 1).\n\n**Residential Care Costs:**\n- After a four-week stay in a care home, residents undergo a financial assessment to determine charges from the fifth week onwards. They are allowed a Personal Expenses Allowance of \u00a330.65 per week, with potential additional allowances (Document 2).\n- If a resident's capital exceeds \u00a323,250, they are typically required to self-fund their care. Once their capital falls below this threshold, they can seek council assistance (Document 6).\n\n**Payment Methods:**\n- Residents pay based on their assessed contribution, which is calculated by the council's Charging Team after evaluating their financial circumstances (Document 4).\n- For residential care, if the chosen care home is more expensive than the council's budget, residents may need to pay a top-up fee (Document 8).\n\nFor more information or assistance, residents should contact Manchester City Council's Adult Social Care services.",
