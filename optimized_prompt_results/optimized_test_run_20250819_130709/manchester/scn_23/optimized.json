Complaints should be raised as soon as possible after the event and in most cases within 12 months of the issue arising.\u00a0 The Council does have some discretion to extend this time limit if, there are reasonable grounds for you not to have submitted your complaint earlier.\u00a0 If a decision is taken not to investigate your complaint due to this time limit, we will notify you of this in writing, detailing the reasons for our decision. Stage 1 If your complaint relates to social care services you should expect to receive a response within 20 working days. If your complaint is complex or covers a number of areas, we may take longer to respond, however, we will tell you if we think this is likely to be the case. When we receive your complaint we will allocate it to an 'investigating officer' from the service your complaint relates",
