  "answer": "The available documents don't provide specific information about whether you will need a new care needs assessment when moving from Manchester to Southampton or if your current care package can transfer. \n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- Typically, when moving to a new local authority area, such as from Manchester to Southampton, you may need to undergo a new care needs assessment by the local authority in your new area. This is because each local authority is responsible for assessing and providing care services to its residents.\n- It is advisable to contact the adult social care department in Southampton to discuss your current care package and what steps you need to take to ensure continuity of care.\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n- **Contact Southampton City Council's Adult Social Care Services**: Reach out to them directly to inquire about the process for transferring your care package and any assessments that may be required.\n- **Prepare Documentation**: Have your current care plan and any relevant documentation ready to share with the new local authority to facilitate the assessment process.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you may want to visit the Southampton City Council's website or contact their adult social care services directly.",
