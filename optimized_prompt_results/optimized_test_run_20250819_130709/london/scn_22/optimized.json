We will ask you to complete an initial financial assessment form. This will ask about your income and capital/savings. The information you give is used to calculate how much you need to contribute towards your care package. Financial Assessments are carried out annually or sooner if your circumstances change (e.g. you must notify us if you receive an inheritance or if you stop receiving a pension or benefit). It is not always necessary to conduct a full financial assessment. For example, if you have savings or wealth, do not wish to undergo a full financial assessment for personal reasons, or if your only income is from benefits. In these cases, a light touch financial assessment will be sufficient",

If you are new to the service, then you will be given a Financial Assessment form which we require all people who are assessed to have long term care needs to complete. If you require assistance completing the form, let us know and this can be provided. \nMost people pay only a small contribution or no charge. \nHowever, some people\u2019s savings are above the threshold and they will pay the full cost of their care. If this is the case, we would consider you to be a self-funder and you can, if you wish to arrange your care and support independently. \nDo you look after someone? \nDo you provide unpaid help and support to a parent, partner, child, relative, friend or neighbour who could not manage without your help, due to age, physical or mental health issues, substance misuse or disability?\n\n[Document 2] From https://www (web_page) - URL: https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/social-care-for-adults/paying-for-adult-social-care/about-financial-assessments [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n.

We will ask you to complete an initial financial assessment form. This will ask about your income and capital/savings. The information you give is used to calculate how much you need to contribute towards your care package. Financial Assessments are carried out annually or sooner if your circumstances change (e.g. you must notify us if you receive an inheritance or if you stop receiving a pension or benefit). It is not always necessary to conduct a full financial assessment. For example, if you have savings or wealth, do not wish to undergo a full financial assessment for personal reasons, or if your only income is from benefits.
