Transitioning to adult healthcare Transferring from health services for children and young people, to health services for adults can be scary, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Young people with complex health needs, requiring continuing health care when they turn 18, will transfer to adult health or adult mental health services. Planning for this transfer will usually begin at the time of the Year 9 review. Your health professional will work with you to develop a transition plan, which identifies who will take the lead in coordinating care and referral to other services.

  "answer": "**Summary:** You will likely need a new care needs assessment when moving from London to Southampton, as care packages are typically not transferable between local authorities.\n\n**Details:**\n- Each local authority in the UK is responsible for assessing and providing social care services to its residents. When you move to a new area, such as from London to Southampton, the new local authority will need to conduct its own assessment to determine your care needs and the appropriate support package.\n- Your current care package from London will not automatically transfer to Southampton, as each local authority operates independently and may have different resources, policies, and eligibility criteria.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Contact the Adult Social Care team in Southampton as soon as possible to arrange a new care needs assessment. This will help ensure there is no disruption in the support you receive.\n- You can find contact details for Southampton's Adult Social Care services on their official website or by calling their main contact number for social services.\n\n**Resources:**\n- For more information on arranging a new assessment, visit the Southampton City Council's website or contact their Adult Social Care department directly.",
