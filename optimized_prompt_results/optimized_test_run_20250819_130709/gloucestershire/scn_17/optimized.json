How to have an assessment of your care and support needs There are lots of things that you can do for yourself, or to help a person that you care for, to be healthy, active and independent for as long as possible. You can choose to arrange this care and support privately, without help from the council.\u00a0See our web page about staying independent for longer for more information. If you would like us to arrange or pay towards any care, you will need to have an adult social care assessment first to see if you are eligible for support. You can do this by contacting Gloucestershire County Council\u2019s Adult Social Care Helpdesk . We will discuss your needs, provide information about support available, and arrange for an assessment, if required",

  "answer": "If your care needs have increased in Gloucestershire, you may be eligible for additional financial support from the council, but this will depend on a financial assessment. **You need to contact Gloucestershire County Council\u2019s Adult Social Care Helpdesk to request a care needs assessment.** This assessment will determine if your needs are eligible for support under the Care Act.\n\n- **Financial Assessment:** If you have eligible needs, the council will conduct a financial assessment to see if you qualify for financial support. You must consent to this assessment by signing and returning a form within four weeks. If your resources are over \u00a323,250, you may not qualify for financial support (Documents 1 and 4).\n\n- **Eligibility for Financial Help:** The council will help fund your care if:\n  - Your needs are eligible under the Care Act.\n  - Your financial assessment confirms entitlement to financial support.\n  - The council can only assist from the day your funds fall below \u00a323,250 or the day you contact them, whichever is later (Document 4).\n\n- **Direct Payments:** If eligible, you can opt for direct payments to arrange your own care. More details are available on the council\u2019s direct payments webpage: [Gloucestershire Direct Payments](https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/direct-payments/) (Document 6).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Contact the Adult Social Care Helpdesk** to discuss your increased needs and request an assessment. You can find more information on their website: [Gloucestershire Adult Social Care](https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/adult-social-care/how-to-have-an-assessment-of-your-care-and-support-needs/).\n2. **Complete the financial assessment consent form** if your needs are deemed eligible.\n\nFor further assistance, you can call the Helpdesk at **01452 583519**.",
