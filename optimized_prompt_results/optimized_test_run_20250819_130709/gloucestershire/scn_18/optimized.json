  "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 in Gloucestershire, his financial support will transition to adult services, which involves a means-tested financial assessment to determine his contribution towards his care costs.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Means-Tested Charges:** Adult social care is not free, and most services provided by the council are subject to means-tested charges. This means your son will undergo a financial assessment to determine how much he needs to contribute towards his care.\n- **Personal Budget:** If your son has a Care Act assessment and the council agrees to meet his eligible needs, they will calculate the total cost of his care, known as his personal budget. The financial assessment will then determine his contribution to this budget.\n- **Possible Outcomes:** Depending on the assessment, he may have to pay part of the cost, the full cost, or, in some cases, nothing at all.\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n- **Seek Independent Financial Advice:** It is recommended to get independent financial advice to understand the options available for paying for care and support.\n- **Contact Information:** For more details, you can visit the Gloucestershire County Council's website on adult social care: [Gloucestershire Adult Social Care](https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/adult-social-care/paying-for-adult-social-care/paying-for-your-social-care/).\n\nBy understanding these steps and preparing for the financial assessment, you can better navigate the transition to adult services for your son.",
