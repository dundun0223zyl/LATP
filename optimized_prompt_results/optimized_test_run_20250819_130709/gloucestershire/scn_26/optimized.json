Our approach has been to work in partnership with parents and organisations in Gloucestershire to make it much more 'ordinary' for disabled children and young people to go to clubs and activities in their own neighbourhoods, with whatever support they need. We want all organisations that provide activities and clubs to be confident to welcome disabled children. How can you get a short break? More and more disabled children can have a break without needing an assessment by asking a local club, child minder or activity provider. If the child care or activity provider needs some additional support to welcome your child they can contact one of our inclusion coordinators who can work with them, you and your child, they can also access training to help them to include disabled children in their setting",

Who can get short breaks? The Gloucestershire Offer All parents and children need breaks, whether they are disabled or not. Our approach has been to work in partnership with parents and organisations in Gloucestershire to make it much more 'ordinary' for disabled children and young people to go to clubs and activities in their own neighbourhoods, with whatever support they need. We want all organisations that provide activities and clubs to be confident to welcome disabled children. How can you get a short break? More and more disabled children can have a break without needing an assessment by asking a local club, child minder or activity provider. If the child care or activity provider needs some additional support to welcome your child they can contact one of our inclusion coordinators who can work with them, you and your child, they can also access training to help them to include disabled children in their setting\n\n[Document 2] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/training-for-health-and-social-care-professionals/multi-agency-training/dementia-training-and-education-strategy-for-gloucestershire/ - 8 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\nYou can request support online  \n \nwww.gloucestershire.gov.uk/gloucestershires -community -help-hub/use   (not for social care referrals)   \n \nExample s of support they can help organise are:  \n \nFood  delivery, dog walking , picking up prescriptions, putting out bins, staying connected calls, \nhelpin g sort out appointments etc, Requests will be sent to district council locality hubs  to organise \nhelp.  \n \nIf you cannot use online forms call 01452 583519 Mon -Fr 8.30am -5pm Sat -Sun 9am -4pm\n\n[Document 3] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/disabilities/autism-and-neurodivergence-partnership-board/ - 10 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 8 - FINANCIAL/BUDGET INFORMATION]\nAll Age\nYour Circle [www.yourcircle.org.uk]: A directory to help you find your way around care and support and\nconnect with people, places and activities in Gloucestershire.\nYou\u2019re Welcome [www.yourewelcomeglos.org]:  An inclusive online directory and forum.
