How to have an assessment of your care and support needs There are lots of things that you can do for yourself, or to help a person that you care for, to be healthy, active and independent for as long as possible. You can choose to arrange this care and support privately, without help from the council.\u00a0See our web page about staying independent for longer for more information. If you would like us to arrange or pay towards any care, you will need to have an adult social care assessment first to see if you are eligible for support. You can do this by contacting Gloucestershire County Council\u2019s Adult Social Care Helpdesk . We will discuss your needs, provide information about support available, and arrange for an assessment, if required",
