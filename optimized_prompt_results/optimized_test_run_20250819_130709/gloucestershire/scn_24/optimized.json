How to have an assessment of your care and support needs There are lots of things that you can do for yourself, or to help a person that you care for, to be healthy, active and independent for as long as possible. You can choose to arrange this care and support privately, without help from the council.\u00a0See our web page about staying independent for longer for more information. If you would like us to arrange or pay towards any care, you will need to have an adult social care assessment first to see if you are eligible for support. You can do this by contacting Gloucestershire County Council\u2019s Adult Social Care Helpdesk . We will discuss your needs, provide information about support available, and arrange for an assessment, if required",

  "answer": "**Summary:** When moving from Gloucestershire to Southampton, you will likely need a new care needs assessment, as care packages typically do not transfer between local authorities.\n\n**Details:**\n- **Care Needs Assessment:** Each local authority in the UK is responsible for conducting its own assessments to determine eligibility for social care services. This means that when you move to a new area, such as Southampton, the local council there will need to assess your care needs to establish a new care package.\n- **Contact Information:** To initiate this process, you should contact the Adult Social Care services in Southampton to arrange for a new assessment. Similarly, you can reach out to Gloucestershire County Council for guidance on transitioning your care.\n\n**Practical Steps:**\n1. **Contact Southampton Adult Social Care:** Reach out to the local council in Southampton to arrange for a new care needs assessment.\n2. **Notify Gloucestershire Council:** Inform Gloucestershire County Council about your move to ensure a smooth transition and to discuss any necessary changes in your care arrangements.\n\nFor more information or assistance, you can contact Gloucestershire County Council's Adult Social Care at:\n- **Phone:** 01452 426868\n- **Email:** socialcare.enq@gloucestershire.gov.uk\n- **Website:** [Gloucestershire Adult Social Care](https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/adults-and-older-people/)\n\nThe available documents don't provide specific information about the process in Southampton, so contacting the local council there will be essential for your transition.",
