  "answer": "Residents of Gloucestershire pay for care services through a means-tested system, where most people contribute towards the cost of their care based on a financial assessment. The Gloucestershire County Council spent approximately **\u00a313.5 million** on care and support for people with physical or sensory impairments during the 2015/16 period.\n\n**Payment Details:**\n- **Means-Tested Charges:** Almost all care and support services arranged or provided by the council are subject to means-tested charges. This means that individuals will pay according to their financial capacity as determined by a national means test.\n- **Personal Budget:** If the council agrees to meet your eligible needs after a Care Act assessment, they will calculate the total cost, known as your personal budget.\n- **Financial Assessment:** A financial assessment will determine how much you must pay towards your personal budget. Some people may pay the full cost, some a portion, and others may not pay anything at all.\n\n**Payment Options:**\n- You can ask the council to arrange all care services for you.\n- You can opt for a direct payment, allowing you to arrange your own care.\n- A combination of council arrangements and direct payments is also possible.\n\n**Resources:**\n- For an estimate of costs, residents can use the council\u2019s online calculator at [gloucestershire.mycostofcare.com/OFA](https://gloucestershire.mycostofcare.com/OFA).\n- It is recommended to seek independent financial advice before entering into care arrangements.\n\nFor more information, residents can visit the Gloucestershire County Council's website on paying for adult social care: [Gloucestershire Adult Social Care](https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/adult-social-care/paying-for-adult-social-care/paying-for-your-social-care/).",
