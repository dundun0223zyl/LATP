Our Adult Carers Strategy is part of achieving this overall aim. \nCarers across the city do fantastic work and we want to ensure with support they are able to \ncontinue their caring role and enjoy a quality of life for themselves. It recognises that unpaid carers are often doing this alongside work or education. Without their efforts, the family member, partner or friend simply wouldn\u2019t be able to manage. Both the individual and communities would be worse off without this care and the council and NHS would be overwhelmed without it. \nWe recognise the strain and additional pressure put on carers by the pandemic and now is the time \nto put carers centre place to ensure they have a good quality of life.\n\n[Document 4] From https://www (web_page) - URL: https://www.southampton.gov.uk/adult-social-care/discharge-to-assess/support-at-care-home/ [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\nIn this section Leaving hospital, short term recovery and assessment services What to expect when you leave hospital Rehabilitation and reablement care visits Short-term home care and support in your own home Short-term support at a care home (current) Who will be working with me?
