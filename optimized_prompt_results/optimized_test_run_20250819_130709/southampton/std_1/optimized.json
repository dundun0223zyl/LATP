This includes both residential and non-residential care options. Transition services are available for young people moving to adult care, focusing on personalized and outcome-focused support (Documents 4 and 5).\n\n**Financial Information:**\n- **Financial Assessment:** A financial assessment is conducted to determine your contribution towards care costs. If assets exceed \u00a323,250, you may need to pay the full cost. If assets are between \u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250, you will pay a contribution from your assets (Documents 1 and 2).\n- **Contribution Calculation:** The council will fund the difference between the cost of your care and your assessed contribution if you are not a full-cost payer (Document 1).\n\n**Practical Steps and Resources:**\n- For more information on eligibility and financial assessments, visit the Southampton City Council website: [Southampton Adult Social Care](https://www.southampton.gov.uk/adult-social-care/paying-for-your-care/paying-social-care-services/).\n- To begin the assessment process, contact Southampton's Adult Social Care services through their website or by reaching out to a local social worker.\n\nThe available documents don't provide specific information about the exact types of care services available or detailed contact information.
