  "answer": "Residents of Southampton pay for care services based on their financial situation, determined through a financial assessment. If their assets exceed \u00a323,250, they are required to pay the full cost of their care. If their assets are between \u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250, they contribute more than those with fewer assets, but not the full cost. For those with assets below \u00a314,250, the contribution is based on their disposable income.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Financial Assessment:** Southampton City Council conducts a financial assessment to determine how much a resident can afford to pay. This assessment considers assets such as property, savings, and income.\n- **Contribution Calculation:** Residents are charged based on their net disposable income. For example, if a resident has a net disposable income of \u00a3100 per week, they will be charged \u00a3100 per week towards their care costs, assuming the care costs exceed this amount.\n- **Asset Thresholds:** \n  - Over \u00a323,250: Pay full cost.\n  - Between \u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250: Pay more than those with fewer assets.\n  - Below \u00a314,250: Contribution based on income.\n\n**Payment Process:**\n- Residents will be invoiced monthly for their contribution, and the council covers the difference between the care cost and the resident's contribution.\n- The council provides an online financial assessment tool, Bettercare, for residents to estimate their contributions.\n\n**Next Steps and Resources:**\n- Residents can find more information and access the financial assessment tool on the Southampton City Council website: [Southampton Adult Social Care](https://www.southampton.gov.uk/adult-social-care/paying-for-your-care/paying-social-care-services/).\n- For further assistance, residents can contact the Financial Assessment and Benefits Team (FAB Team) through the council's contact page.",
