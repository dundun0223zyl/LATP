Moving into residential care is a big decision and can have major financial implications.\n\nIf you have over \u00a323,250 in savings you will be required to pay for the full costs of your care. If you have less than this amount in savings you may be entitled to financial help if it is agreed by you and social services that this is the best kind of care for you.\n\nIf you wish to move into residential care and you have sufficient income and resources to pay for this yourself, you may arrange this independently. However, if most of your assets are tied up in your home, you may still wish to approach the council for help.\n\n[Document 2] From https://www (web_page) - URL: https://www.southampton.gov.uk/adult-social-care/care-info-professionals/the-care-act/ [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n.
