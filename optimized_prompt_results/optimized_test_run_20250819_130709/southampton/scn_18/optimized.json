  "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 and transitions to adult services in Southampton, his financial support will be determined by a financial assessment conducted by the local authority. This assessment will calculate how much he can afford to contribute towards his care costs.\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: Southampton City Council will update the financial assessment to calculate your son's contribution towards his care. This will depend on his assets and income. If his assets are below \u00a323,250, he will not be considered a full-cost payer.\n\n- **Contribution Details**: If his net disposable income is \u00a3100 per week, he will be charged \u00a3100 per week towards his care costs, assuming the care costs more than this amount. If he has assets between \u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250, he might pay a bit more, as this includes a contribution from his assets.\n\n- **Asset Consideration**: Assets such as property, land, savings, and shares will be considered in the financial assessment, as per the Care Act 2014.\n\n- **Practical Steps**: You can use the online financial assessment portal, Bettercare, available on the Southampton City Council website, to get an early indication of the likely contribution.
