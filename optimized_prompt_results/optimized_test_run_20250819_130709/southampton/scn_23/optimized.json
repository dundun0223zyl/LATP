Even if you think you won\u2019t qualify, you should still apply. Sometimes other funding may be available based on your assessed needs. Who is responsible for maintenance of my adaptation? If a stair lift is installed, you can choose to waive your ownership of it, meaning it will be owned and maintained by Southampton City Council or your housing association. (Housing associations cover maintenance only after your five-year warranty, which is included in your grant, expires.) For all other adaptations, contractors usually provide a one-year warranty. After this, maintenance is your responsibility. Private landlords or housing associations may agree to take responsibility for the adaptation, but this is at their discretion.
