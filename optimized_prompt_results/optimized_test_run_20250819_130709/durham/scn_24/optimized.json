  "answer": "You will need a new care needs assessment when moving from Durham to Southampton. Care needs assessments are specific to the local authority where you reside, and each local authority is responsible for assessing and meeting the care needs of its residents.\n\n- **New Assessment Requirement**: When you move to a new area, such as from Durham to Southampton, the local authority in Southampton will need to conduct its own assessment of your care needs. This is because care needs assessments are tailored to the services and resources available in each specific area.\n\n- **Process**: You should contact the social services department in Southampton to arrange for a new Care and Support Assessment. This assessment will determine what services you are eligible for in your new location.\n\n- **Contact Information**: To start this process, you can reach out to the social services department in Southampton for guidance on how to proceed with your assessment.\n\nFor further assistance, you may want to contact Social Care Direct in Durham at scd@durham.gov.uk or by phone at 03000 267 979 to discuss your current care needs and get advice on transitioning your care to a new location.",
