Adult Care and Support in County Durham What you need to know At some point in our lives, many of us may need help to enable us to live as well as possible with an illness or disability. This help, known as care and support, is the term used to describe assistance given by family and friends, as well as any help provided by other people or organisations including the council. Care and support can include help with things like getting out of bed, washing, dressing and meal preparation. It may also include emotional support at times of difficulty or stress\n\n[Document 7] From https://www (web_page) - URL: https://www.durham.gov.uk/article/22111/Special-educational-needs-and-disabilities-SEND-Health-family-support-and-social-care [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n.
