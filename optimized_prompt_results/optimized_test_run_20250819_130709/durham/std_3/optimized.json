  "answer": "Residents in Durham may be required to contribute to the cost of their social care services based on a financial assessment, as per the Care Act 2014. The specific costs and contributions are determined by this assessment, which evaluates what each individual can afford to pay.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Financial Assessment:** Durham County Council conducts a financial assessment to determine how much a resident can contribute towards their care services. This is in line with Section 17 of the Care Act 2014.\n- **Charges:** Charges for care services commence from the start of the service. Residents may be charged the full cost of both residential and non-residential services if they are paying the full fee.\n- **Extra Care Charges:** These include a standard charge for overnight and emergency response services, plus charges for the assessed care hours as identified in the care plan. The actual charge will be the lesser of the sum of these costs or the service user's assessed maximum contribution.\n- **Social Care Activities:** Costs for social care activities are calculated over a 3-month period and divided by 13 weeks, with a maximum of \u00a310.00 per activity. Meals for carers during social care activities can be included at a maximum of \u00a35.00 per meal if detailed in the care plan.\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n- For more detailed information about specific costs and to begin the financial assessment process, residents can visit the Durham County Council's webpage on care and support services: [Durham County Council - Paying for Care and Support](https://www.durham.gov.uk/article/5765/How-much-you-will-have-to-pay-for-care-and-support-services).\n\nThis information is based on the documents provided and may be subject to change.
