If you need 'nursing care' you may be entitled to funding from the NHS for all or part of the cost. To find out if this is the case, you will need an assessment by a social worker and registered nurse. What to do if you need care and support immediately or in the near future Always check first with the council about any support they can give. The council will assess your care and support needs and those of your carers. If your circumstances meet the conditions for support and you wish the council to pay towards the cost of services, they will then assess your income assets and capital (such as savings)",
