This could be a result of dementia, a brain injury or stroke, or a person with a mental health problem or with a learning disability. The Mental Capacity Act ensures that the rights of vulnerable adults are protected. It also enables people to plan for a time when they may lose capacity. Under this Act you can have access to an independent advocate. This is a person who speaks up for others who will ensure that your wishes are considered.

If the person is in immediate danger call 999. Support with making decisions (advocacy) Every day we make decisions about lots of things in our lives. The ability to make decisions is called mental capacity. Some people have difficulty making decisions, either some or all the time. This could be a result of dementia, a brain injury or stroke, or a person with a mental health problem or with a learning disability. The Mental Capacity Act ensures that the rights of vulnerable adults are protected. It also enables people to plan for a time when they may lose capacity. Under this Act you can have access to an independent advocate. This is a person who speaks up for others who will ensure that your wishes are considered.
