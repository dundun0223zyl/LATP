Budgets are getting tighter while people\u2019s needs are getting more complex. We are \ngood at working efficiently and will keep building on this so that we are making best use of limited \nmoney and resources to meet people\u2019s needs, while continuing to improve access and tackle \ninequalities.  We want to provide people with the best possible support whilst also ensuring the \nbest possible value for money.  We will use data, evidence and best practice to achieve this. \nWhat we know from our data:\n\u2022 The council has a total net revenue \nbudget of \u00a3296.6 million, and \n46% of the budget is allocated to \nadult social care (\u00a3135.8 million in \n2023/24).",

Budgets are getting tighter while people\u2019s needs are getting more complex. We are \ngood at working efficiently and will keep building on this so that we are making best use of limited \nmoney and resources to meet people\u2019s needs, while continuing to improve access and tackle \ninequalities.  We want to provide people with the best possible support whilst also ensuring the \nbest possible value for money.  We will use data, evidence and best practice to achieve this. \nWhat we know from our data:\n\u2022 The council has a total net revenue \nbudget of \u00a3296.6 million, and \n46% of the budget is allocated to \nadult social care (\u00a3135.8 million in \n2023/24).\n\n[Document 2] From 024155%20 %20BC4278%20 %20BARNET%20 %20ASC%20Strategy%202024%20%E2%80%93%202029%20%5BFINAL%203%5D (pdf) - 26 pages [Retrieved via: financial_enhanced]:\ncare, with needs for care and support \nincreasing.
