We will ask for \nfinancial information from the person applying to enter into the agreement with the \nCouncil . Failure to keep up with top -up payments may result in you being asked to \nmove to a suitable alternative home available at a cost the Council would usually \nexpect to pay.  \n \nN.26.

We will ask for \nfinancial information from the person applying to enter into the agreement with the \nCouncil . Failure to keep up with top -up payments may result in you being asked to \nmove to a suitable alternative home available at a cost the Council would usually \nexpect to pay.  \n \nN.26.
