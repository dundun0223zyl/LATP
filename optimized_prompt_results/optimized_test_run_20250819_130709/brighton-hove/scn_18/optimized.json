  "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 in Brighton-Hove, his financial support will be assessed under the adult social care system. This transition involves a financial assessment to determine his contribution towards the cost of services, unless he has a substantial care package costing over \u00a3900, in which case he will not have to pay for the service.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Financial Assessment:** Upon transitioning to adult services, your son will undergo a financial assessment to determine his eligibility and contribution towards care costs. This is standard for all individuals eligible for adult social care.\n- **Substantial Care Package:** If the cost of his care package exceeds \u00a3900, he will not be required to pay for the service.\n- **Adult Social Care Charging Reform:** Although reforms to make the means-test more generous and introduce a cap on care costs were planned for October 2023, they have been delayed to October 2025. These reforms could affect future financial assessments and contributions.\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n- **Contact Adult Social Care Services:** For more detailed information and to start the assessment process, contact the Brighton-Hove Adult Social Care team. You can find resources and contact information on their [website](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/adult-social-care/about-adult-social-care).\n- **Explore Support Options:** Utilize the online 'Self-Service' Adult Social Care Hub to explore available support options and get advice tailored to your son's needs.\n\nThe available documents don't provide specific information about changes in specific financial support amounts when transitioning from children's to adult services. For detailed guidance, contacting local adult social care services is recommended.",
