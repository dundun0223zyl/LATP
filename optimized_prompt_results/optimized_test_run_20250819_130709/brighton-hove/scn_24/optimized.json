This includes when the Council is responsible for funding care and accommodation in residential or nursing home care and complies with the Care Act 2014. Also included within scope of this policy are people living in their own homes and people who were previously self-funding their own care arrangements. 1.2 In summary, an assessment under the auspices of the Care Act 2014 will determine whether a person has eligible care and support needs. The assessment will include whether a person is eligible for care and support needs to be funded by the Council. The Council will listen and take account of the service user's preferences as to how those needs are met",

  "answer": "You will need a new care needs assessment when moving from Brighton & Hove to Southampton. Care packages do not automatically transfer between local authorities.\n\nWhen you move to a new area, the local authority in your new location (Southampton) will need to conduct a new assessment to determine your care needs and eligibility for services. This is in line with the Care Act 2014, which requires local authorities to assess individuals' care and support needs to determine eligibility for services.\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n- Contact Southampton City Council's Adult Social Care services to arrange for a new care needs assessment.\n- You can find more information and contact details on their official website or by visiting their local office.\n\nFor further assistance, you may want to visit the Southampton City Council website or contact their Adult Social Care department directly.",
