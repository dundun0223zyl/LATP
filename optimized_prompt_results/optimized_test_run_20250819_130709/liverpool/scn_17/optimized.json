  "answer": "If your care needs have increased in Liverpool, you may be eligible for additional financial support from the council. **Liverpool City Council considers disability benefits like Attendance Allowance in their financial assessments for care services.** This means your current benefits are factored into determining your eligibility for additional support.\n\n- **Disability Related Expenditure (DRE):** The council assesses DRE to ensure you retain enough benefits to cover necessary expenses not met by the council. If your current allowance does not reflect your needs, you can request a reassessment.\n\n- **Direct Payments:** You can opt for direct payments, which give you flexibility in arranging your care services. This allows you to purchase support that meets your assessed needs and outcomes.\n\n- **Requesting a Review:** If you feel your current support is insufficient, you can contact Careline to request a review of your care and support plan. This review will determine if additional support is necessary.\n\nFor more information or to request a review, you can visit the Liverpool City Council's website or contact their Careline service.
