There may be something you can access that will mean you do not need a formal assessment or support from adult social care. How to request an assessment If you or someone you know is eligible under the Care Act you can complete an assessment online . This will ask you some questions to find out a bit more about your circumstances. What happens next? Depending on your circumstances, we may decide to carry out a full care needs assessment. This gives us an opportunity to ask what will help you to improve your wellbeing and live how you want to live. We will ask what's important to you and make sure the plan is tailored to help achieve your specified outcomes. If we don't feel a full care needs assessment is appropriate we will discuss other options with you",
