We refer to the Care Act eligibility to determine if a person is eligible for support. The decision-making process for adults with care and support needs is based on the following outcomes: Do the needs arise from a physical or mental impairment or illness? Do these needs mean that the adult is unable to achieve two or more of the listed outcomes? Is there consequently a significant impact on the adult's wellbeing? If you think you may need support from adult social care, finding out about things in your local area can be a good starting point",

We provide advice and support to adults from the age of 18 who may have: a physical or sensory impairment, a learning disability, a mental illness,\u00a0and adults whose independence is at risk due to age or frailty. We refer to the Care Act eligibility to determine if a person is eligible for support. The decision-making process for adults with care and support needs is based on the following outcomes: Do the needs arise from a physical or mental impairment or illness? Do these needs mean that the adult is unable to achieve two or more of the listed outcomes? Is there consequently a significant impact on the adult's wellbeing? If you think you may need support from adult social care, finding out about things in your local area can be a good starting point\n\n[Document 7] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.liverpool.gov.uk/adult-social-care/already-receiving-care-services/direct-payments/ - 21 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 21]\nLiverpool City Council \u2013 Guide to direct payments  \nPage 20 of 21 \u2022 E: enquiries@healthwatchliverpool.co.uk  \n\u2022 W: healthwatchliverpool.co.uk  \n \nLive Well Liverpool  City Region  \nAn online  directory  of services,  support  and activities.
