This will ask you some questions to find out a bit more about your circumstances. What happens next? Depending on your circumstances, we may decide to carry out a full care needs assessment. This gives us an opportunity to ask what will help you to improve your wellbeing and live how you want to live. We will ask what's important to you and make sure the plan is tailored to help achieve your specified outcomes. If we don't feel a full care needs assessment is appropriate we will discuss other options with you",
