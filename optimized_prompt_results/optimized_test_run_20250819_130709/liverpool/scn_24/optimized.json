  "answer": "You will need a new care needs assessment when moving from Liverpool to Southampton, as care packages do not automatically transfer between local authorities.\n\nWhen you move to a new area, the local authority in your new location (Southampton) will need to conduct their own assessment to determine your eligibility for services and to create a care plan that meets your needs. This is because each local authority is responsible for assessing and providing care to residents within their area. \n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Contact the adult social care department in Southampton to request a new care needs assessment.\n- Inform Liverpool City Council of your change of address to ensure they update their records and discontinue your current services appropriately.\n- You can find more information on how to request an assessment by visiting the Southampton City Council's website or contacting their adult social care services directly.",
