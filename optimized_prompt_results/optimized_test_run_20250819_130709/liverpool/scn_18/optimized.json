  "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 in Liverpool, his financial support will transition to adult services, which includes a financial assessment to determine his contribution towards care costs. The assessment will consider his income, benefits, and any disability-related expenses.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Financial Assessment:** Liverpool City Council will conduct a financial assessment to determine how much your son can contribute towards his care. This assessment will take into account his income, including benefits such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP) or Disability Living Allowance (DLA).\n- **Disability-Related Expenditure (DRE):** If your son receives disability benefits, a DRE disregard of **\u00a324.16** will be automatically applied to the calculation of his charge. This amount is reviewed annually. You can request a further DRE assessment if you believe his disability-related costs exceed this standard allowance.\n- **Capital Limits:** If your son has savings or capital, the financial assessment will consider these. Capital below **\u00a314,250** is ignored, but if it exceeds this amount, an assumed income of \u00a31 per week for every \u00a3250 will apply. If his capital exceeds **\u00a323,250**, he may not be entitled to financial support.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- **Contact Liverpool City Council:** For more detailed information and to initiate the financial assessment process, visit [Liverpool City Council's Adult Social Care page](https://www.liverpool.gov.uk/adult-social-care/who-we-support/care-charges/paying-for-care-and-support-at-home/).\n- **Request a DRE Assessment:** If you believe your son's disability-related expenses are higher than the standard allowance, request a further assessment through the council.\n\nFor further assistance or specific queries, contacting Liverpool City Council directly will provide the most tailored support for your son's transition to adult services.",
