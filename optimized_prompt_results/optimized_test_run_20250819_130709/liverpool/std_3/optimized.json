  "answer": "Residents in Liverpool may be required to pay for non-residential care services based on a financial assessment conducted by Liverpool City Council. The assessment determines the individual's contribution towards the cost of their care, ensuring that no one is left with less than the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) after charges are applied.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Financial Assessment:** Residents receiving chargeable care packages undergo a financial assessment to determine their contribution. This includes a benefits maximisation check to ensure they receive all entitled benefits (Document 2).\n- **Contribution Limits:** The assessed charge is the maximum amount a person would be asked to pay, and it cannot exceed the actual cost of providing the care (Document 3).\n- **Capital Threshold:** Individuals with capital over \u00a323,250 may be charged an administration fee for arranging care, though each case is considered individually (Document 1).\n- **Direct Payments:** Residents can receive direct payments to manage their own care, with contributions deducted based on the financial assessment (Document 10).\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n- For more detailed information on care charges and financial assessments, visit the Liverpool City Council's website at [liverpool.gov.uk/payingforcare](https://www.liverpool.gov.uk/payingforcare).\n- Residents can contact Liverpool City Council for assistance with financial assessments or to discuss their specific circumstances.\n\nThe available documents don't provide specific information about the exact costs of care services in Liverpool.",
