A deferred payment agreement is another option if you do not wish to sell your home yet. If you think you are going to have support needs, the law says you must not give away your money or property to avoid or reduce paying for care.

If you are a self-funder (paying for your own care) with savings over \u00a323,250 you will need to make arrangements to pay the care home directly. A private arrangement between you and the care home means that the weekly rate will be different to the council contracted rate.

A financial assessment will look at your money to see how much you can afford to pay towards your care each week. If this amount is not enough, you may qualify for help to pay. You will not qualify for help to pay if: the financial assessment shows you can afford to pay for all of your care you choose to arrange your care privately you choose not to have a financial assessment or do not give us all the information we need You'll be offered a benefit check by a member of the Benefits Maximisation Service , who will make sure you are receiving all the benefits you are entitled to.

You can also ask for a 'loan-style DPA' secured against your home. This is where the council loans you the money for your residential care placement. You can ask us for further information about this scheme during your assessment. How much will it cost? We will charge a fixed fee of \u00a3450 to set up a DPA and an annual fee of \u00a3144 for ongoing administration costs whilst the DPA is in place. Interest will also be charged on the outstanding debt. The maximum interest rate to be charged is fixed by the government and is reviewed on 1st January and 1st July each year. Currently it is 4.65 per cent, as of 1st July 2025. You can pay the set-up and annual fees as and when they are charged, or add them to the amount you will eventually repay. All fees relate to the cost to Liverpool City Council for administering a DPA only and are subject to review at any time. Who is eligible? You should be eligible for a DPA if you: Are receiving care in a care home or nursing home, or you are going to move into one soon\n\n[Document 9] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.liverpool.gov.uk/adult-social-care/who-we-support/care-charges/paying-for-care-and-support-at-home/ - 41 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 7 - FINANCIAL/BUDGET INFORMATION]\nLiverpool City Council \u2013 Charging for non -residential care services  \nPage 6 of 41 \u2022 Their total assessable income is less than or equal to the minimum income \nguarantee established by Central Government plus an additional 10 per cent.   \nor  \n\u2022 An individual\u2019s assessed contribution is under LCC\u2019s minimum charge.  \n5 Charging and financial assessments for \nservices in non -residential settings  \n5.1 Undertaking a financial assessment  \nWhere a person is identified as receiving a chargeable care package, a financial \nassessment will be undertaken to identify their level of contribution towards the cost \nof their care.  \nA person will be offere d assistance to complete a financial assessment t o ensure all \nrelevant detail is collated regarding their income and expenditure.
