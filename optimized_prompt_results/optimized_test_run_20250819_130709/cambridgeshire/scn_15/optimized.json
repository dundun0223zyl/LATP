Symptoms include memory loss, confusion and problems with speech and understanding. There are 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, with numbers set to rise.\u00a0One in three people in the UK has a family member or close friend who is living with Dementia. Dementia is a profoundly life-changing condition, and is often people\u2019s biggest fear in later life. People with dementia and their carers have asked for more support to do things in the community. This includes more opportunities to participate\u00a0in activities and better access to services to maintain their independence. People living with dementia can still have a good quality of life at most stages of the condition, provided the right care and support is in place.\u00a0We want to work towards making Cambridgeshire a dementia supportive community",

Dementia is caused when parts of the brain stop working properly due to disease or trauma. Symptoms include memory loss, confusion and problems with speech and understanding. There are 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, with numbers set to rise.\u00a0One in three people in the UK has a family member or close friend who is living with Dementia. Dementia is a profoundly life-changing condition, and is often people\u2019s biggest fear in later life. People with dementia and their carers have asked for more support to do things in the community. This includes more opportunities to participate\u00a0in activities and better access to services to maintain their independence. People living with dementia can still have a good quality of life at most stages of the condition, provided the right care and support is in place.\u00a0We want to work towards making Cambridgeshire a dementia supportive community\n\n[Document 4] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets - 13 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 5 - FINANCIAL/BUDGET INFORMATION]\n \n \n5 | Cambridgeshire County Council \u2013 Paying for your own care and support when you leave hospital  - Easy \nRead | July  2024 \n Pictures  Words  \n \n \n Care Network  offer a free Help at Home Service for \nup to six weeks.  \n \nIn Cambridge, South Cambs and East Cambs you can call 01223 714433 or email hah.south@care-\nnetwork.org.uk  \n In Huntingdonshire and Fenland, you can call 01354 694413 or email hah.north@care -network.org.uk  \n \n \n Care Network also have Community Navigators . \nCommunity Navigators  can help you to find the \ninformation you need about support and activities.  \n They can also suggest other organisations which can help you.  \nYou can find out more on www.care -network.org.uk  \n Alzheimer\u2019s Society offer support to people with dementia coming out of hospital and their carers.  \n You can find out more at www.alzheimers.org.uk\n\n[Document 5] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets - 13 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 5 - FINANCIAL/BUDGET INFORMATION]\n \n \n5 | Cambridgeshire County Council \u2013 Paying for your own care and support when you leave hospital  - Easy \nRead | July  2024 \n Pictures  Words  \n \n \n Care Network  offer a free Help at Home Service for \nup to six weeks.  \n \nIn Cambridge, South Cambs and East Cambs you can call 01223 714433 or email hah.south@care-\nnetwork.org.uk  \n In Huntingdonshire and Fenland, you can call 01354 694413 or email hah.north@care -network.org.uk  \n \n \n Care Network also have Community Navigators . \nCommunity Navigators  can help you to find the \ninformation you need about support and activities.  \n They can also suggest other organisations which can help you.  \nYou can find out more on www.care -network.org.uk  \n Alzheimer\u2019s Society offer support to people with dementia coming out of hospital and their carers.  \n You can find out more at www.alzheimers.org.uk\n\n[Document 6] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets - 7 pages [Retrieved via: semantic_original]:\n[Page 3 - FINANCIAL/BUDGET INFORMATION]\n \n3 | Cambridgeshire County Council \u2013 P aying for your own care and support when you leave hospital  \n| August 2024 \n Also, there are a number of voluntary sector and community groups who \nprovide services specifically to help people with care and support needs.  \n \nCare Network offers a free Help at Home service, for up to six weeks of \npractical and emotional support for any adult who has come out of \nhospital.
