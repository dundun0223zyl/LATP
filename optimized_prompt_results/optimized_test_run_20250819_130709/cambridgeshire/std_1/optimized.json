  "answer": "In Cambridgeshire, social care services are available to individuals who have undergone a social care assessment and a financial assessment, determining their eligibility for council-funded care and support. These services include personal budgets, direct payments, and various forms of care such as in-home care, residential care, and support for mental health, learning, or physical disabilities.\n\n**Eligibility Criteria:**\n- **Social Care Assessment:** Individuals must have a social care assessment to determine their needs and strengths. This assessment helps identify the support required and provides information and advice to help individuals remain independent.\n- **Financial Assessment:** Eligibility for financial assistance is determined through a means-tested financial assessment. Those with savings over \u00a323,250 are considered self-funding, while those with savings below this threshold may receive council contributions towards their care costs.\n\n**Services Available:**\n- **Personal Budgets:** Eligible individuals receive a personal budget, which is an amount of council funding to meet their social care needs.\n- **Direct Payments:** Individuals can choose to receive direct payments to arrange their own care services.\n- **Care Types:** Services include care in one's own home, residential care, nursing care, and support for personal care or mental health needs.\n\n**Practical Steps:**\n- If you believe you need social care services, contact Cambridgeshire County Council for an assessment. Details can be found at [Cambridgeshire County Council's website](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support).\n- For more information on financial assessments and personal budgets, refer to the council's care and support information sheets available online.\n\nAccording to the documents, the council provides guidance and support for those eligible, ensuring that individuals can access the necessary services to maintain their well-being and independence.",
