  "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 and transitions to adult services in Cambridgeshire, his financial support will be determined by a social care assessment and a financial assessment. **The amount of council funding available to him will be calculated based on his care and support needs.**\n\n- **Personal Budget**: If eligible, your son will receive a personal budget, which is a specific amount of council funding to meet his assessed social care and support needs. This budget is calculated weekly and can be used to cover the costs of his care.\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: This assessment will determine how much he may need to contribute towards his care costs. If he has savings or investments over \u00a323,250, he will be considered a self-funder and will need to pay for his own care. If his savings are between \u00a314,250 and \u00a323,250, he may need to contribute partially, with the council covering some costs. Savings below \u00a314,250 will not be counted in the assessment.\n\n- **Changes in Financial Situation**: It's important to inform the council if there are significant changes in his income or capital. If his capital is nearing the threshold of \u00a323,250, you should notify the council when it is approximately \u00a328,000 to ensure appropriate planning.\n\nFor more information or to start the assessment process, you can visit the Cambridgeshire County Council's website at [Cambridgeshire County Council Adult Services](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/adults/organising-care-and-support/care-and-support-information-sheets).",
