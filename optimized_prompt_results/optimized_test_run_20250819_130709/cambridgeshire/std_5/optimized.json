Additionally, communication barriers have been identified, with residents facing difficulties navigating local systems or accessing online information. These challenges often stem from language barriers and a lack of clarity or accessibility to official information. \nResidents consistently emphasised the need for better access to primary care services. For healthcare partners, including the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Integrated Care Board, there is a pressing need to ensure that residents, particularly those in rural areas, can access timely and effective primary care. Expanding services and addressing barriers such as transportation and digital exclusion will be critical to achieving equitable healthcare access across Cambridgeshire.",
