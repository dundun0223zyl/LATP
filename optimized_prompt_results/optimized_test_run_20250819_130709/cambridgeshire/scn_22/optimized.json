  "answer": "To prepare for a financial assessment for care in Cambridgeshire, you should gather documents related to your **income, savings, capital, and benefits**. The assessment will determine your contribution towards care costs based on these financial details.\n\n- **Income**: Include all sources of income such as pensions, wages, or any other regular payments.\n- **Savings and Capital**: Provide details of any savings accounts, investments, and the value of any property you own. If your capital or savings exceed **\u00a323,250**, you will be required to pay the full cost of your care.\n- **Benefits**: Include information on any benefits you receive, as these will be considered in the assessment.\n\nIf your capital is below **\u00a323,250**, the council may contribute to your care costs. However, if your home is occupied by a partner, children under 18, or an older or disabled relative, it will not be included in the capital assessment.\n\nFor more information or if you have questions about the financial assessment process, you can contact the Cambridgeshire County Council's Financial Assessment Team at **0300 126 3003** or visit their website at [www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk) and search for \"paying for care\".",
