Over the last 30 years, Kent has lost more land to urbanisation and housing than any other county, and this increases the county\u2019s risk of being impacted by major weather events such as flooding. Kent\u2019s natural environment is one of the county\u2019s greatest assets, providing benefits for our quality of life and economy, and must be protected and strengthened. The council has made significant progress towards its ambition to reach Net Zero for its own services and estate by 2030 and is working with partners on Net Zero for Kent as a whole. Work to reduce energy and carbon emissions also reduces costs and so contributes to meeting the challenge of rising costs as well as improving energy security. The ongoing challenge is the trade-off between immediate cost pressures and the investment required to fund environment projects that save money, adapt to existing climate change and mitigate against future adverse impacts.",

Over the last 30 years, Kent has lost more land to urbanisation and housing than any other county, and this increases the county\u2019s risk of being impacted by major weather events such as flooding. Kent\u2019s natural environment is one of the county\u2019s greatest assets, providing benefits for our quality of life and economy, and must be protected and strengthened. The council has made significant progress towards its ambition to reach Net Zero for its own services and estate by 2030 and is working with partners on Net Zero for Kent as a whole. Work to reduce energy and carbon emissions also reduces costs and so contributes to meeting the challenge of rising costs as well as improving energy security. The ongoing challenge is the trade-off between immediate cost pressures and the investment required to fund environment projects that save money, adapt to existing climate change and mitigate against future adverse impacts.\n\n[Document 4] From https://www (pdf) - URL: https://www.kent.gov.uk/about-the-council/strategies-and-policies/service-specific-policies/adult-social-care-policies/accommodation-strategy-for-adult-social-care - 53 pages [Retrieved via: financial_enhanced]:\n[Page 5 - FINANCIAL/BUDGET INFORMATION]\nThis document must  not be used in isolation.
