  "answer": "In Kent, additional resources and support services for social care users include community support services, advocacy, and complaints services. These services aim to help individuals live independently and improve their well-being.\n\n- **Community Support Services**: Kent provides information and advice on available community support services, including social and peer support groups. This is facilitated through the Kent Connect to Support website, which offers guidance on various aspects of adult social care, such as health and wellbeing, housing, and financial advice. You can access this resource at [Kent Connect to Support](https://kent.connecttosupport.org).\n\n- **Advocacy Services**: While specific advocacy services are not detailed in the documents, Kent County Council collaborates with independent and voluntary sector organizations to provide support. For more information, you can contact Kent County Council's adult social care services at **03000 41 61 61** or via text relay at **18001 03000 41 61 61**.\n\n- **Complaints Services**: The documents do not explicitly mention complaints services, but typically, local authorities have procedures in place for handling complaints related to social care. You can reach out to Kent County Council directly to inquire about their complaints process.\n\n- **Mental Health Services**: Kent works with the Kent and Medway Partnership Trust and a network of mental health services to support individuals with mental health issues, focusing on day-to-day living, socializing, education, training, employment, and housing.\n\nFor further involvement or to provide feedback on social care services, you can join the \"Your Voice\" network at [www.kent.gov.uk/yourvoice](https://www.kent.gov.uk/yourvoice).\n\nFor more detailed information or to explore additional options, visiting the Kent County Council's website or contacting their social care services directly would be beneficial.",
