During the assessment A carer's assessment is about you and your physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\u00a0It's an informal discussion that can happen face to face or over the telephone at a time that's convenient for you. We'll talk to you about the ways that caring affects your life and\u00a0what could make things better for you and the person you look after. You won't need to do a financial means test as part of the carer's assessment but you might be asked about what impact the cost of caring is having on your finances. Having a carer's assessment will not affect whether or not you receive a carer's allowance . After the assessment We'll use what you tell us during your assessment to produce a support plan to help you carry on doing the things that are important to you and your family",

During the assessment A carer's assessment is about you and your physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\u00a0It's an informal discussion that can happen face to face or over the telephone at a time that's convenient for you.
