There are 3 types of service a carer can offer. We are currently recruiting for long term and short breaks carers. Long term - where an adult would move in and your home would become their home. Short breaks - where an adult would stay for a night or 2, a weekend or a few weeks with the carer based on what is needed. Day support - one session lasting up to 5 hours based at the carer's home or out and about in the community",
