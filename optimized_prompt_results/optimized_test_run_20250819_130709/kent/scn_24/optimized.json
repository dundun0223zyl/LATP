If the person you care for does not live in Kent County Council's area you should contact the council covering the area where they live. During the assessment A carer's assessment is about you and your physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\u00a0It's an informal discussion that can happen face to face or over the telephone at a time that's convenient for you. We'll talk to you about the ways that caring affects your life and\u00a0what could make things better for you and the person you look after. You won't need to do a financial means test as part of the carer's assessment but you might be asked about what impact the cost of caring is having on your finances.

  "answer": "**You will likely need a new care needs assessment when moving from Kent to Southampton.** Care packages typically do not transfer between local authorities due to differences in local services and funding arrangements.\n\n- **Care Needs Assessment:** Each local authority is responsible for assessing and meeting the care needs of individuals residing in their area. Therefore, when you move to Southampton, the local authority there will need to conduct a new assessment to determine your eligibility for services and the specific support you require.\n\n- **Contact Information:** To initiate a new assessment in Southampton, you should contact the local adult social care services. While the documents do not provide specific contact details for Southampton, you can usually find this information on the Southampton City Council's website or by calling their main customer service line.\n\n- **Practical Steps:** \n  - Before moving, inform Kent County Council of your plans to relocate so they can provide any necessary documentation or information that might assist the new assessment.\n  - Upon arrival in Southampton, reach out to the local adult social care services to schedule your assessment.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you may want to visit the Southampton City Council website or contact their social services department directly.",
