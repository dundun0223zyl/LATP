We'll talk to you about the ways that caring affects your life and\u00a0what could make things better for you and the person you look after. You won't need to do a financial means test as part of the carer's assessment but you might be asked about what impact the cost of caring is having on your finances. Having a carer's assessment will not affect whether or not you receive a carer's allowance . After the assessment We'll use what you tell us during your assessment to produce a support plan to help you carry on doing the things that are important to you and your family",
