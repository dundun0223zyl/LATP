  "answer": "**Summary:** The costs of care services in Kent are determined by an individual's financial assessment, which decides how much they contribute towards their care. Some residents pay nothing, while others contribute partially or fully, depending on their income and assets.\n\n**Details:**\n\n- **Payment Structure:** According to Kent County Council's Charging Policy, residents' payments for adult social care are based on an assessment of their income. This determines whether they pay nothing, contribute partially, or pay the full cost of their care. Those who pay the full cost are referred to as \"self-funders\" (Documents 7 and 8).\n\n- **Funding and Budget:** The council is facing increased costs and demand for services, which may lead to changes in the Adult Social Care Charging Policy to ensure sustainability (Document 7).\n\n- **Financial Support:** The council provides financial support for those who cannot afford to pay for their care, ensuring that services are accessible to all who need them (Documents 7 and 8).\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n\n- For more information on the Charging Policy and how payments are calculated, residents can visit the Kent County Council's adult social care page: [Kent Adult Social Care](https://www.kent.gov.uk/social-care-and-health/adult-social-care).\n\n- Residents can also contact the council directly for personalized advice and support regarding their care costs and financial assessments.",
