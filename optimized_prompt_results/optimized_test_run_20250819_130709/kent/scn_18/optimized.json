  "answer": "When your son with learning disabilities turns 18 in Kent, his financial support will transition to adult services, which may involve a reassessment of his financial contributions towards care. **Most people will have to contribute toward the cost of their care**, but the exact amount depends on an assessment of his income and financial situation.\n\n- **Financial Assessment**: Kent County Council (KCC) will assess his income to determine how much he might need to pay towards his care. Some individuals pay nothing, while others contribute partially or fully, depending on their financial circumstances (Document 7).\n\n- **Charging Policy**: The KCC Charging Policy outlines how payments are structured for care in a person's home or community, but it does not apply to residential care homes (Document 7).\n\n- **Direct Payments**: If your son opts for direct payments, he will need to pay his contribution into a direct payment account to ensure there are sufficient funds for his support (Document 10).\n\n- **Resources for Financial Advice**: You can seek advice from organizations like Money Helper and the Society of Later Life Advisers for more information on planning for care costs, benefits, and budgeting (Document 5).\n\nFor more detailed information or to initiate an assessment, you can contact the Direct Payment Support Team at 03000 413 600 or visit the Kent County Council website at [www.kent.gov.uk/careandsupport](http://www.kent.gov.uk/careandsupport) (Document 10).",
