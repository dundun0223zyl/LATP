Alongside increasing demand we are now seeing substantial reductions in the budgets of local authorities and pressure on public sector funding in general. Whilst local authorities have successfully delivered major efficiencies over recent years, Government funding is not keeping pace with the cost of providing \nservices. Nottingham City Council has seen \na reduction of 72% in its Revenue Support Grant over the past 6 years and has fallen from \u00a3126.8m in 2013/14 to \u00a335.0m in 2018/19. The council has addressed this by successfully tackling efficiency through innovation and making savings. However, with even greater pressure, we need to think again about how we meet our commitments to citizens for their social wellbeing within the resources we have available. \nincreasing costs",
