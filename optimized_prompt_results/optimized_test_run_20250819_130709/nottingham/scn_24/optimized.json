  "answer": "When moving from Nottingham to Southampton, you will need to inform both your current local authority in Nottingham and the new one in Southampton to ensure continuity of care. While your current care package cannot automatically transfer, the councils have a legal duty to work together to facilitate a smooth transition of your care services.\n\n- **Continuity of Care**: Local authorities are required to ensure that when an individual receiving care moves to a new area, they continue to receive necessary support. This involves collaboration between the current and new councils.\n  \n- **Action Steps**:\n  - **Notify Both Councils**: Contact the Nottingham City Health and Care Point at 0300 300 3333 to inform them of your move. Also, reach out to the council in Southampton.\n  - **Assessment in New Area**: The new council in Southampton will likely conduct a new care needs assessment to determine any changes in your care requirements due to the move.\n\n- **Further Information**: For detailed guidance on continuity of care, you can visit the Government's website at www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-act-2014-part-1-factsheets/care-act-factsheets--2#factsheet-9-continuity-of-care-when-moving-between-areas.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help ensure that your care needs are met promptly after your move.",
