However, adult social care services are under increasing pressure: demand is increasing due to longer life expectancies and people living with longer periods of long term ill-health, the National Living Wage is having a significant impact on care costs along with inflation and funding \nfrom national Government to local councils has \nbeen cut year on year. Nottingham faces the double impact of higher levels of deprivation \nmeaning a greater proportion of citizens rely \non state support, alongside lower levels of \nfunding raised through council tax. The cost \nof providing adult social care has begun to outstrip the available resources and this is \nnot sustainable. In 2017, the council reviewed \nits adult social care services and asked the \nfollowing questions: \n1) How efficiently are services being run?",
